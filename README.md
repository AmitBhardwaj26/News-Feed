# Project Title

Instagram-like News Feed and Profile Page

## Overview

This project aims to create a web application that simulates Instagram's News Feed and Profile section. The application is designed to display a user's profile, their uploaded images, and their interactions with other users' posts.

The project uses Nextjs for the frontend and server-side rendering, and the Unsplash API to fetch images. It also leverages various CSS modules for styling and responsiveness.

## Features

- **News Feed:** Users can scroll through a feed of images uploaded by different users. The images are displayed in a grid layout, similar to Instagram's feed.

- **Profile Section:** Users have their own profile page that displays their profile picture, username, name, and the number of posts.


## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/AmitBhardwaj26/News-Feed)
2. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Obtain an API key from the Unsplash API and replace `YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
5. Open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Upon opening the application, users will be directed to the News Feed, where they can scroll through images uploaded by various users. Users can like and comment on the images and view the image description by hovering over the image.

To access their own profile, users can click on their profile picture at the top right corner. This will take them to their profile page, where they can view their own uploaded images, profile details, and interactions.

The application is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and style when viewed on different devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

## Development Process

The project was developed using React and Next.js to achieve server-side rendering and improve performance. The application utilizes CSS modules for styling to avoid conflicts and ensure modularity.

The Unsplash API is used to fetch images for the News Feed. The application was designed with performance and efficiency in mind, allowing for smooth and quick loading of images and interactions.
